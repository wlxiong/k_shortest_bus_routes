Summary
=======

The k-shortest transit paths algorithm contains two parts. 
The first part computes the least transfer times matrix, 
which provides a _heuristic_ value to the second part, 
the k-shortest transit paths searching.

An revised _Bellman-Ford_ algorithm is implemented to search 
the first k shortest paths from one source to all the other 
destinations. The algorithm is implemented and tested with 
a real world transit network including more than _500 lines 
and 4000 stops_.
